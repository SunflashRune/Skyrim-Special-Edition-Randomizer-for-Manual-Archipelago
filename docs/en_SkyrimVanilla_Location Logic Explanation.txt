Skyrim(Vanilla) Archipelago Manual Randomizer Version 0.5

This document will attempt to summarize and then detail the various bits of Logic that is used to lock out certain parts of the game until their Items are acquired.

Summary:

	You begin with access to 1 Offensive-class Skill, 1 of EITHER a Defensive or Support Skill; and Unbound, escaping Helgen. Your two Starting skills are visable at the start of the game, so it is suggested you connect your Manual Client to the Server before you start your game, to possibly pick a race that works well. You will also always acquire 1 Skill(of any kind) after completing Unbound.
	
	You will now have access to 6 Daedric quest Locations, all 5 Fishing quest Location, 5 Housing Locations, 4 Bounty Locations, all 3 Standing Stones Locations,  and all 3 Word Wall Locations.
	
	Each of the Main Quest Locations, and the Faction Quest Locations, need to be Unlocked before you can complete their various Quests. This unlocking is done by acquiring a certain amount of Progressive quest items.
	
	In addition, all Dragon-slaying Locations(General and Bounty) are locked behind three "MainQuestProgressive" Items.
	
	Similarly, 5 more Daedric quest Locations also require four "MainQuestProgressive" Items.
	
	Finally, the last 3 Daedric quest Locations require twelve "MainQuestProgressive" Items.
	
	
Details:
	First, I will list each Location and its corresponding logical locking item(if any). Then I will explain in some detail why I settled on each logical lock, for those curious.

The 3 Factions follow roughly the same pattern as each other:
Requires CompanionProgressive/CollegeProgressive/GuildProgressive items.

The first College quest (First Lessons) ALSO Requires ONE OF Destruction/Conjuration/Illusion/Restoration or Alteration.
	Revaling the Unseen (5 College Progressives) will always Require Destruction for that quest to be in Logic.
The first Companions quest (Take Up Arms) ALSO Requires EITHER one-handed or two-handed skill.
The first Guild quest (Chance Arrangement) ASLO requires Sneak AND Pickpocket AND Lockpicking.
 
Each following Quest will require at least one "X"Progressive item before you can access the Location.

Of special note:

ANY entry to Whiterun will be 'out of logic' without either A) a MainQuestProgressive that allows you to do the Riverwood conversations and get the 'Riverwood calls for the Jarl's aid' option with the Whiterun gate guard, or B) Speech Skill unlock, allowing you to choose the persuade option. This is mostly important for doing Bandit Bounty quests early on; you won't be able to 'legally' turn in Whiterun Hold Bounties without meeting one of the two options above. There is currently nothing in logic accounting for this, but also shouldn't actually block you from anything at the moment as there is no Whiterun-only stuff.

Riften can be entered by a back door(The Black Briar Meadary near the Fishery), but the front door needs Speech to access via the guard's persuade/bribe option. Bribing still levels up the Speech skill, and is therefore considered a use of the Speech skill.

Hunter's Prey - Slay 3 out of the following list:
	A Snow Bear
	A Snow Sabre Cat
	A Mammoth
	An Ice Wolf
	The Frost Giant (Forgotten Vale)
	Nimhe (Giant Frostbite Spider in Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site)
	Spriggan Earth-Mother
	Vale Sabre Cat (Darkfall Cave/Forgotten Vale)
