## Installation Procedures


Download the manual_skyrimspecialedition_sunflashrune.apworld
Copy the .apworld file to your .../Archipelago/custom_worlds/ folder.
In your .../Archipelago/ folder, run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe
From there, you should click the 'Generate Template Options' button the left-hand side. (NOTE: If you had the Launcher open before moving the .apworld into your custom_worlds folder, you MUST close and relaunch the Launcher in order for the program to generate the Template properly.)
Go to your .../Archipelago/Players/Templates/ folder, and copy the manual_skyrimspecialedition_sunflashrune.yaml file found therein.
Place your .yaml file in your .../Archipelago/Players folder, and then open it(Notepad++ is suggested to edit .yamls)


Once open, edit your 'name: Player{number}' field found near the top, and examine the rest of the document for any Options you wish to enable or disable.
You may save the edited yaml with the original file-name, or you may change it in order to help distinguise various options you have saved.
