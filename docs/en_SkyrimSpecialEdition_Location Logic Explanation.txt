Skyrim Special Edition Archipelago Manual Randomizer Version 0.6

This document will attempt to summarize and then detail the various bits of Logic that is used to lock out certain parts of the game until their Items are acquired.
There is also a Poptracker Pack available at https://github.com/SunflashRune/Skyrim-Special-Edition-Manual-AP-PopTracker-Pack/releases
If you do not have Poptracker, it is located here https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases
and it's Discord can be found at the following link: https://discord.com/invite/gwThqMCPgK

Summary:

	You begin with access to 1 Offensive-class Skill, 1 of EITHER a Defensive or Support Skill; and Unbound, escaping Helgen. Your two Starting skills are visable at the start of the game, so it is suggested you connect your Manual Client to the Server before you start your game, to possibly pick a race that works well.
	At character creation and assuming you have the associated skills, you start allowed to equip/wield/cast the following Tiers of equipment: Hide/Fur/Studded/Vampire for Light Armor, Iron/Banded Iron/Ancient Nord for Heavy Armor, Iron and Ancient Nord for Weapons, and Novice for Spells.
	If you do not have the associated Light/Heavy Skills, you are not allowed to wear ANYTHING that says it is either of those types of Armor. Same thing with missing One-Handed/Two-Handed/Bows, and for Spells.
	You will also always acquire 1 Skill(of any kind) after completing Unbound.
	
	You will now have access to 2 Fishery Quests (Angler Acquaintances and Catch of the Day), 1 Bounty Objective(Bandit Bounties Complete = 3), and 3 Misc Objectives(Standing Stones Foun = 4, Word Walls Read = 1, and Slay 6 Wolves, 2 Sabre Cats, and 1 Bear).

	Each of the Main Quest Locations, and the Faction Quest Locations; need to be Unlocked with a respective Progressive Item (Main Quest Progressive, Companion Progressive, etc) before you can start their various Quests.
	All NON-Faction Quest Locations are locked by an amount of Main Quest Progressives, which will be detailed below.
	Each Main Quest Progressive acquired will grant you the ability to complete the associated Main Quest Location, as well as anywhere from 0-8 SideQuest/Objective/Daedric Locations.
	
	Of Special Note: The Speech Skill locks ANY persuasion, bribe, or intimidate use. This means that entering Whiterun is techinally locked until you have EITHER Main Quest Progressive 1 (to start Before the Storm in Riverwood, allowing you access to the "Riverwood calls for the Jarl's aid" non-speech skill option with the Guard), or the Speech skill.
	Riften can be entered by a back door(The Black Briar Meadary near the Fishery), but the front door needs Speech to access via the guard's persuade/bribe option. Bribing still levels up the Speech skill, and is therefore considered a use of the Speech skill.
	There are several actual AP Locations that require Speech as well, and these will be noted below.

	
Details:
	First, I will list each Location and its corresponding logical locking item(if any). Then I will explain in some detail why I settled on each logical lock, for those curious.
